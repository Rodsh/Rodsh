- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rodsh
- 👀 I’m interested in Creating Games from scratch 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Game development and I am one year away from college so I am preparing myself for computer science
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that might be a good source of knowledge and experience 
- 📫 I am currently planning to go solo, but I might be open for collabs soon (when I have enough experience)
